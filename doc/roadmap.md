There are many potential places development resources can be allocated and they will be chosen based on market needs with highest priority given to requests that will primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.

Almost since its beginning MWC has encountered very sophisticated heavily funded attacks by various mining consortiums who have attempted to destroy the network. Consequently, while the friendly miners are greatly appreciated the operating assumption is that miners are actively hostile and malicious towards the long-term interests of the buyers and hodlers of last resort and the network.
